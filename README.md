# SlowAndFastApproach

--> Slow And Fast Approach is a technique used in Linked List.

--> Where the slow pointer traverses the linked list one by one and the fast pointer traverses the linked list at twice the speed of the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, slow pointers remain in the middle of the list.

--> By this technique we can find the middle node of the linked list by O(N/2) time complexity.
